## An Example Message Queue System with RabbitMQ

Here I made a sample study on how to create a message queue system with "RabbitMQ", which is a message queue system.

## What is RabbitMQ ?

 RabbitMQ is an asynchronous message queuing system between communicating systems. A message is created and the generated message is accepted and transmitted to the relevant place (queue) for consumption. Our consumer tool, which constantly listens to this queue, also receives the incoming messages and sends a message to the manufacturer that the message is gone.
 
 Written in the Erlang programming language and built on the Open Telecom Platform framework, today RabbitMQ runs on several operating systems and cloud environments and provides a range of developer tools for many popular languages.
 
 Message Broker; is the general name given to message queue systems. RabbitMQ is just one of them. Kafka, MSMQ vs. other message queue systems.
